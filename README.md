# PapyrusTrader
 PapyrusTrader is an algorithmic trading system for options built on top of the Alpaca API. The system leverages advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms to generate trading signals and execute trades automatically.v

## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/PapyrusTrader.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Alpaca API credentials in config.json
Run the script: python papyrus_trader.py
## Configuration
config.json contains the following parameters:

alpaca_key: Your Alpaca API key
alpaca_secret: Your Alpaca API secret
model: The statistical model to use for generating trading signals (e.g. "Random Forest", "ARIMA")
threshold: The minimum confidence threshold for making a trade (between 0 and 1)
max_positions: The maximum number of positions to hold at once
